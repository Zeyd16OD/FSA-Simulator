# Finite Automata Simulator
This project is a graphical application developed in C# using Visual Studio Community 2022. It is designed to simulate and verify finite automata, allowing users to define states, transitions, and alphabets, verify words against the automaton, and perform automaton 3 # 
determinization.

### Features
##### Alphabet Handling:

Input and validate alphabets, ensuring they consist of single letters or digits.
##### State Management:

Define and validate states.
Manage state transitions and display them in a DataGridView.
Automaton Verification:

Verify if a given word is accepted by the defined automaton.
##### Determinization:

Convert a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) and display the result.
##### User Interface:

TextBoxes for inputting alphabets, states, transitions, initial state, final states, and words.
Buttons for verifying words and launching determinization.
DataGridViews for displaying the original automaton and the deterministic automaton.
